# Blackjack:
* This is a simple browser game of blackjack that was develoved to play
a simple game of beating the dealer while not going over 21.

# How to play Blackjack:
The browser has five buttons to choose from to play the game at your pace or have fun to mess around with. 
* Deal - Clicking starts the game and draws cards for both the player and dealer(opponent)
* Hold - This will end the game with the current cards on the table and tell you who won the hand. Can be clicked when you feel that the player has a higher hand than the opponent but does not wish to draw an extra card and accidentally lose by going over 21.
* Player/Dealer Draw - Both buttons will allow an extra card to be pulled from either side when you click on the respective button and the game will notify you what the current state of the match is after the first pull. You can pull more cards and as long as it isn't over 21, the player can still win the match.
* New Game - A reset of the board to delete the cards in the table and start the game before the deal button was pressed.
